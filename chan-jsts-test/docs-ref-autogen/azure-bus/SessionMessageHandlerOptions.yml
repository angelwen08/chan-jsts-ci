      {boolean} [autoComplete] Indicates whether the message (if not settled by
      the user)

      should be automatically completed after the user provided onMessage
      handler has been executed.

      Completing a message, removes it from the Queue/Subscription.

      {number} [maxConcurrentCalls] The maximum number of concurrent calls that
      the library

      can make to the user's message handler. Once this limit has been reached,
      more messages will

      not be received until atleast one of the calls to the user's message
      handler has completed.

      {number} [newMessageWaitTimeoutInSeconds] The maximum amount of time the
      receiver

      will wait to receive a new message. If no new message is received in this
      time, then the

      receiver will be closed.


      Caution: When setting this value, take into account the time taken to
      process messages. Once

      the receiver is closed, operations like
      complete()/abandon()/defer()/deadletter() cannot be

      invoked on messages.


      If this option is not provided, then receiver link will stay open until
      manually closed.
