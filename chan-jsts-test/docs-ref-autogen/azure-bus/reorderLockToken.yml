    summary: >-
      If you try to turn a Guid into a Buffer in .NET, the bytes of the first
      three groups get

      flipped within the group, but the last two groups don't get flipped, so we
      end up with a

      different byte order. This is the order of bytes needed to make Service
      Bus recognize the token.
    syntax:
      content: 'function reorderLockToken(lockTokenBytes: Buffer)'
      parameters:
        - id: lockTokenBytes
          type:
            - Buffer
          description: ''
      return:
        type:
          - Buffer
