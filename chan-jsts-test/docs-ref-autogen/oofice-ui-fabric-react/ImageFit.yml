      The image is scaled to maintain its aspect ratio while being fully
      contained within the frame. The image will

      be centered horizontally and vertically within the frame. The space in the
      top and bottom or in the sides of

      the frame will be empty depending on the difference in aspect ratio
      between the image and the frame.
