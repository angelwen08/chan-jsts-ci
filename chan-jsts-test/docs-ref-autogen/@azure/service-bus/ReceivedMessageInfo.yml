      The unique number assigned to a message by Service Bus.

      The sequence number is a unique 64-bit integer assigned to a message as it
      is accepted

      and stored by the broker and functions as its true identifier. For
      partitioned entities,

      the topmost 16 bits reflect the partition identifier. Sequence numbers
      monotonically increase.

      They roll over to 0 when the 48-64 bit range is exhausted.


      **Max safe integer** that Javascript currently supports is `2^53 - 1`. The
      sequence number

      is an AMQP `Long` type which can be upto 64 bits long. To represent that
      we are using a

      library named [long.js](https://github.com/dcodeIO/long.js). We expect
      customers

      to use the **`Long`** type exported by this library.
