      Indicates whether the `complete()` method on the message should
      automatically be

    summary: >-
      The maximum number of concurrent calls that the sdk can make to the user's
      message

      handler. Once this limit has been reached, further messages will not be
      received until atleast

      one of the calls to the user's message handler has completed.

      The maximum duration in seconds until which the lock on the message will
      be renewed

      by the sdk automatically. This auto renewal stops once the message is
      settled or once the user

      provided onMessage handler completes ite execution.


      - **Default**: `300` seconds (5 minutes).

      - **To disable autolock renewal**, set this to `0`.

      The maximum amount of time the receiver will wait to receive a new
      message. If no new

      message is received in this time, then the receiver will be closed.


      If this option is not provided, then receiver link will stay open until
      manually closed.


      **Caution**: When setting this value, take into account the time taken to
      process messages. Once

      the receiver is closed, operations like
      complete()/abandon()/defer()/deadletter() cannot be

      invoked on messages.
