      Gets or sets the path which is present in each document in the Azure
      Cosmos DB service for last writer wins conflict-resolution.

      This path must be present in each document and must be an integer value.

      In case of a conflict occurring on a document, the document with the
      higher integer value in the specified path will be picked.

      If the path is unspecified, by default the timestamp path will be used.

      This value should only be set when using
      <xref:ConflictResolutionMode.LastWriterWins>.


      ```typescript

      conflictResolutionPolicy.ConflictResolutionPath = "/name/first";

      ```

    optional: true
    syntax:
      content: 'conflictResolutionPath?: string'

      Gets or sets the <xref:StoredProcedure> which is used for conflict
      resolution in the Azure Cosmos DB service.

      This stored procedure may be created after the <xref:Container> is created
      and can be changed as required.

      1. This value should only be set when using
      <xref:ConflictResolutionMode.Custom>.

      2. In case the stored procedure fails or throws an exception, the conflict
      resolution will default to registering conflicts in the conflicts feed.

      conflictResolutionPolicy.ConflictResolutionProcedure = "resolveConflict"
