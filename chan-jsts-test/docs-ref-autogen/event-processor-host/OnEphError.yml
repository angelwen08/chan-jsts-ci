      Describes the error handler signature to receive notifcation for general
      errors.

      Errors which occur while processing events from a particular EventHub
      partition are delivered

      to the `onError` handler provided in the `start()` method. This handler is
      called on

      occasions when an error occurs while managing partitions or leases for the
      partitions.
    syntax:
      content: 'type OnEphError = (error: EPHDiagnosticInfo) => void'
