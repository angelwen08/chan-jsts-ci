      The SessionReceiver class can be used to receive messages from a session
      enabled Queue or

      Subscription in a batch or by registering handlers.

      Use the `createReceiver` function on the QueueClient or SubscriptionClient
      to instantiate a

      SessionReceiver.

      The SessionReceiver class is an abstraction over the underlying AMQP
      receiver link.
