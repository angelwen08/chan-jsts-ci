      setting this value enables assigning related messages to the same internal
      partition,

      so that submission sequence order is correctly recorded. The partition is
      chosen by a hash

      function over this value and cannot be chosen directly.

      - For session-aware entities, the `sessionId` property overrides this
      value.

      or relative path of

      the queue or topic it expects the reply to be sent to. See

      supplied DateTime value must also be in UTC. This value is for delayed
      message sending.

      It is utilized to delay messages sending to a specific time in the future.
      Message enqueuing

      application-defined value specifies

      the session affiliation of the message. Messages with the same session
      identifier are subject

      to summary locking and enable exact in-order processing and
      demultiplexing. For

      accepted and stored by the broker, as captured in `enqueuedTimeUtc`. When
      not set explicitly,

      `timeToLive` value cannot be longer than the entity's DefaultTimeToLive

      transfer queue partition:

      This is functionally equivalent to `partitionKey` property and ensures
